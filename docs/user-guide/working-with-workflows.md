title: 'Working with Workflows'
---

A Lawme project contains a set of flows. These flows can call each other by using a [Subflow Block](../block-reference/subflow). Any flow can call any other flow in the project (including itself).

## Creating a Workflow

To create a new project, choose **New Workflow** in the File menu. This will create a new blank project. The new project is unsaved by default.

## Workflow Info

Go into the **Workflow Info** tab of the left sidebar to give your project a new name and optionally a description. This is simply metadata and does not affect the execution of the project.

## Saving a Workflow

Press **Ctrl+S** or **Cmd+S** to save the project, or choose **Save Workflow** in the File menu. This will save the project to the file system. If the project has not been saved before, you will be prompted to choose a location to save the project.

You can press **Ctrl+Shift+S** or **Cmd+Shift+S** (or choose **Save Workflow As**) to save the project to a new location.

## Opening a Workflow

To open a project, choose **Open Workflow** in the File menu or press **Ctrl+O**/**Cmd+O**. This will open a file dialog where you can choose a project to open. The project will be loaded into Lawme as the current project.
