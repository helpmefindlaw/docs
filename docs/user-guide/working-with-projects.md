A Rivet project contains a set of graphs. These graphs can call each other by using a [Subgraph Node](../node-reference/subgraph). Any graph can call any other graph in the project (including itself).

## Creating a Project

To create a new project, choose **New Project** in the File menu. This will create a new blank project. The new project is unsaved by default.

## Project Info

Go into the **Project Info** tab of the left sidebar to give your project a new name and optionally a description. This is simply metadata and does not affect the execution of the project.

## Saving a Project

Press **Ctrl+S** or **Cmd+S** to save the project, or choose **Save Project** in the File menu. This will save the project to the file system. If the project has not been saved before, you will be prompted to choose a location to save the project.

You can press **Ctrl+Shift+S** or **Cmd+Shift+S** (or choose **Save Project As**) to save the project to a new location.

## Opening a Project

To open a project, choose **Open Project** in the File menu or press **Ctrl+O**/**Cmd+O**. This will open a file dialog where you can choose a project to open. The project will be loaded into Rivet as the current project.
