2. **Name**: Enter the name for your new employee. This can be anything that helps you or your team easily identify their role (e.g., "Contract Assistant").
3. **Role**: Define the role of the virtual employee. The role should reflect the main function they will perform, such as Legal Researcher, Contract Reviewer, or Data Analyst.

## Step 4: Set up your contact methods via applications

Setting up your Applications (contact channels), such as chat, email, or Slack, allows you to effectively communicate and collaborate with your virtual employees. 

### Applications (contact channels)

'Create New Application':

1. Go to your new employee's profile page and click on **"Create New Application"**.
2. **Configure the Application**: Specify the Interaction type (e.g., Chat Assistant, Email) and configure its settings.
3. **Assign Workflows & Tools**: Determine which workflows and tools the Interaction will use to perform tasks.

- **Workflows**: Assign workflows by clicking on the Workflows tab in the Application Builder. You can choose from default workflows or custom workflows you've built in the Workflow Builder. Ensure that workflow titles and descriptions are descriptive for better AI task matching.
- **Tools**: Assign pre-built tools that handle specific tasks, such as the Read File tool or Legal Research tool. Tools enable the application to respond to short, simple requests, enhancing its functionality.

#### Current available Applications (contact channels)

- **Chat Assistant**: The chat assistant provides a web-based chat interface for interacting with your virtual employee. You can customise the hub's appearance, default prompts, and the Terms of Use footer in the Interactions Hub Builder.

- **Email**: Assign an email address to your virtual employee using the Email Account interaction type. The email address will have the domain @mail.lawme.ai. You can customise the prefix in the Interactions Hub Builder, allowing your team to communicate directly with the virtual employee via email.

- **Slack Bot**: Integrate your virtual employee as a Slack Bot to interact with your team directly through Slack channels. This enables seamless collaboration and task assignment right from your team's workspace.



## Tips for Creating Effective Employees
- **Be Specific with Roles**: Clearly define the tasks this employee will handle to make assignment easier and enhance productivity.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Names that reflect the employee’s role help the whole team understand what they do at a glance.
- **Leverage Avatars for Visual Cues**: The avatars help visually distinguish between multiple employees in your workforce.

With your new virtual employee set up, you can now assign workflows and leverage them to streamline your firm’s operations. Let’s get started expanding your AI-powered team today!
