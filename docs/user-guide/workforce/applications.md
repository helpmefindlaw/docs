Assign your virtual employees applications to enable them to communicate over chat, email, MS Teams and more.

Applications provide an interface for your broader team interact with your virtual employees. Chat with your virtual employees or assign them work and let them get busy in the background.

## Application Builder

To create a new application, you must configure the application in the Application Builder. The Application Builder allows you to specify an applicaiton type, configure the settings for this application and assign workflows and tools to your application to scope what functions your virtual employee can perform from this application.

### Assigning Workflows & Tools

#### Workflows

To assign workflows and tools to an applicaiton, click on the workflows tab in the Applciaiton Builder and search for the workflow you would like to assign. You may assign any of the default workflows built by Lawme or any of the published worfklows you have built yourself in the Workflow Builder. For custom workflows, please ensure that the title and description of the workflow is descriptive enough to aid the AIs ability to intelligently select the right workflow for the request at hand.

#### Tools

In addition to worfklows, you can assign pre-built tools to your application that perform one off tasks. Tools are for short simple requests and grant your application additional functionality. Examples of tools are the `Read File` tool or `Legal Research` tool.

- Read File: The read file tool enables the employee to read any attached files in a chat context for the purpose of sumarise or conversing over the file.
- US Legal Research: The legal research tool provides the employee with the ability to search over our massive laws database to discover US law.

### Application Types

#### Chat Assistant

The chat assistant provides a web based chat interface for your to interact with your virtual employee. This interface can be configured in the Applicaiton Builder to customise the applications appearance, default example prompts and the Terms of Use footer.

#### Email

The email account application assigns an email address to your virtual employee at the domain `@mail.lawme.ai`. In the Applciation Builder, you may customise the prefix of the email address in the settings configuration. Please note that an email address must be unique for your account or organisation.

Once an email address application is published for your virtual employee, you will be able to communicate with the resource over email. Try it out with one of the default virtual employees For example, ask our legal research assistant Chloe to draft a research report on "the rights of tenants in North Carolina" and let her get busy.
