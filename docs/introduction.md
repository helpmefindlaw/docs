# Introduction

Welcome to the Lawme User Guide!

Lawme enables practices to scale their operations by augmenting their teams with a virtual workforce of AI employees trained on their processes and knowledge bases. 

## Key Concepts

### Workforce

Your workforce is the collection of virtual employees created in the platform. Each employee is assigned a role on creation that defines their area of focus and allocated numerous workflows and document stores to empower the employee to action work and research over your internal data or public knowledge bases.

### Workflow

A workflow represents a process an employee must follow to execute a piece of delegated work. Workflows are assigned to your virtual employees to teach them how to complete work and what internal processes / methodologies they must follow when completing work. Each workflow is designed in-app in with our Workflow Builder.

### Document Stores

A document store is a collection of documents that form a knowledge base (e.g. contracts, guidelines & policies or invoices). Upon creation of a document store, you may define what structured data you would like to extract from each document to build the document register. For example, a document store of contracts might want to extract the parties, effective date, renewal period, etc. from the contracts so that this information forms a register for quick and easy use. 

Besides structuring your documents and providing AI-native search, document stores can also be connected to workflows and employees to leverage the knowledge in these documents while building workflows or for general Q&A with your employee.
